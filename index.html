        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          My name is Julian. I'm 38 years old and I live in Rixensart. I'm the father of a lovely little girl named Siya.
        </p>

        <p class="intro">
          After a career as IT Technician and Facilities Project Manager, I lost my job and left with a long paid notice period. I used this opportunity to first train myself in various wellness techniques.
          the actual world being what it is, I had to change my plan and decided last year to start coding.
          Here I am today with a few online courses and a 6 months training in web developemnt in my bag, ready to learn about JAVA!

          <h3>Padel</h3>
          <p>For a bit more than a year, as it was the only sport playable with the COVID crisis, I invested myself in this quite recent sport. As a tennis and squash player, I had to learn and change my game to progress.
            Padel is a really fun sport, as it is played in double, you get the chance to spend some quality time with your friends. A few month ago, I even decided to start taking lessons and register for a few local tournements... Nothing too fancy tho ;) </p>
